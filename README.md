# CricInfo-WebScraper
A WebScraping Project - The user can scrap data from ESPN Website and store it in the local machine in the form of PDF in the respective folder of every team.
The main objective of this project was to get familiar with JavaScript along with learning a useful activity i.e. Data Scraping from Websites. Also I've learned various NPM modules like axios, jsdom, pdf-lib, excel4node, path, fs, minimist and the usages of them.
